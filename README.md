# Star Fox
## Practice 2 - Modeling and Visualization (MiV)

This project aims to develop a 3D level inspired by the classic game Star Wing, utilizing OpenGL for Android devices. The level will feature essential elements such as terrain, backgrounds, doors, enemies, and the main ship, all integrated with a simple lighting system and a user interface (UI) that displays player information.

To meet the project requirements, the implementation must include loaded .obj meshes, 3D lighting, a 2D HUD, camera movement and rotation, camera switching, and animated 3D elements. The evaluation will focus on functional correctness, graphic quality, complexity, and the originality of the solutions provided. Finally, the project must be submitted as a .zip file containing the code and a demonstration video on Moodle.
